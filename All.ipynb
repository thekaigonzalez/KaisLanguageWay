    "Kai's Programming languages usually start out with a couple of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `BaseLexer` Class, defines a Lexer that breaks down the code into smaller pieces.\n",
    "- A `BaseParser` Class, Defines a parser for semantic data analysis.\n",
    "- A `BaseStatement` Class, this is before a lexer.\n",
    "- A `Runner` class, this runs code. Mostly interactive, but sometimes it's a straight shot.\n",

    "\n",
    "There's this one rule which defines how memory is handled. It's called the \"OPFWYU\" Rule. (Only Pay For What You Use).\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule says....\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the statement is of type THIS:\n",
